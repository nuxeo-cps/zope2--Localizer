Localizer 1.0.0 released!

Localizer is a Zope product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.

The changes of this release are:

 - The dynamic global request patch is not installed if the static
   version (by Tim McLaughlin) is already applied.

 - Now the Localizer.changeLanguage method accepts the optional
   parameter "goto", if specified the redirection will be to the
   given url, instead of the referer.
