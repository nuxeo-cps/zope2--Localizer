ROADMAP 1.0.x
-------------

New releases of 1.0.x will be made from the CVS branch "branch-1-0",
it will consist of bug fixes and minor new features. Nothing is planned,
the changes will depend on the users feedback and contributions.


ROADMAP 2.0
-----------

Development will continue on the CVS trunk. The next big release will
probably be Localizer 2.0

The biggest change will be the development of a Python module that Localizer
will require to work. This module will be named "localizer" (with lowercase),
it will provide to Python programmers as many as posible of the features that
now the Localizer product provides to Zope developers.

The localizer module will include new still not defined features. For
exmaple features addressed to translation memory systems and standards
support (TMX, XLIFF, etc..)

The Localizer product will include new Zope/CMF specific features, not
yet defined.






Open bugs
---------

 * Bo M. Maryniuck:

   "I can't reproduce the error anymore though I can't send you traceback,
    but I just found, that Localizer crashes Medusa threads if someone else
    object uses "register before traverse". In my case there is an product,
    which is always modifies the request. So if I put there also Localizer,
    you'll never enter the site.


 * Localizer can't be refreshed since Zope 2.4.1b1.


 * (Zope bug) See if something feasible can be done to remove the hardcoded
   use of Latin-1 encoding from Zope and Localizer.

   If not, explain which the problems are and what the developer can
   do (add this as a task for the documentation).


 * When importing a message catalog, should be done something with
   the header? When managing the message catalog through FTP, should
   the header also be editable?


 * François Meehan:

   "Also found that using the import/export function in Localizer/zope
    can bring corruption to the po file, a problem with the accents it
    seems."


 * Document the path where Localizer.changeLanguage sets the cookie,
   which is the path from where it is called, not its physical path.
   See the mails exchanged with Claus Rosenberger. Maybe a FAQ?


User interface (ZMI)
--------------------

 * Complete the help screens.


 * Be sure the framed messages appear in all the management screens every
   time an action is performed, i.e. "Content changed (2002-02-08 15:26).


 * The "import/export" management screen should allow to import and
   export any language, not only the ones already available in the
   message catalog.


 * Show the languages ordered in the LPM interface (Gari).


 * Add PrincipiaSearchSource


 * Add property sheets. A property sheet would appear as a tab in the
   Zope management screens.



API
---

 * When importing modules from Localizer, either the sort or the long
   way should always be used. Update the documentation to reflect it
   (Rainer Thaden).

   Where the sort form is:

     from Products.Localizer import LocalPropertyManager

   and the long form is:

     from Products.Localizer.LocalPropertyManager import LocalPropertyManager

   See if this can be addressed without compromising backwards compatibility,
   if not document exactly which is the current situation.


Documentation
-------------

 * Add a section "Localizer application anatomy" to the tutorial:

    "One thing you may want to consider is an overview of how a site
     using all the products should be laid out. The examples and guide
     you are providing are very very good and explain all the techcinal
     components of the variouse packages quite well. What seems to be
     missing is a higher level view that ties it all together in terms
     of layout for a demo site.

     An example of a 2-3 language basic site that uses the variouse
     components  would be very attractive for new programs and users
     (moi) and help the adoption of this most excellent product."

                                                   Chris Herrnberger


  * Re-do the chapter "For Python programmers".


  * Comment about "management_page_charset" to switch the ZMI to utf-8,
    or maybe patch Zope so they're in utf-8 by default.


New features
------------


 * Work on locale information: dates, money, etc..


 * Integrate the File System Message Catalog from CMFLocalizer.


 * Provide support for the i18n namespace of PageTemtamplates.


 * Add the ability to manage localized versions of standard files
   in a product: the on-line help system, README.txt, etc..


 * Let to implement ZClasses that inherite from 'MessageCatalog'


 * Support standards: TMX, XLIFF, etc..


 * Set the 'Vary' header.

   The problem is: which value should it have?

   This could allow to remove the patch to Zope for images, if UA
   take care of the 'Vary' header.


 * Implement the whole mapping interface in the Accept classes (Bjorn).


 * Rework 'changeLanguageForm' to support browsers without javascript.


 * Build user management interfaces similar to the ZMI
   (standard_html_header/footer instead of manage_page_header/footer
   and manage_tabs).
