This module implements the Accept-Charset and Accept-Language request
headers of the HTTP protocol.

There're six classes: Node, Root, CharsetNode, LanguageNode, AcceptCharset
and AcceptLanguage.

The public interface is provided by the two last classes, AcceptCharset and
AcceptLanguage. The other four shouldn't be used directly.
