Localizer 0.9.2 released!

Localizer is a Zope product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.

This is a bug fix release, the changes are:

 - The "zgettext.py" script correctly parses Python files, to do
   it the xgettext program from the GNU Gettext utilities is used.

 - Now "zgettext.py" don't preserves the old messages in the
   locale.pot file.

 - Updated the Unicode patch, by Florent Guillaume.

 - In some rare conditions the request object dissapears from the
   global dictionary, this produces a key error when it's tried to be
   removed. Fixed catching the exception (I couldn't reproduce the
   error).

And a new "feature":

 - Added the new module "LocalizerSupport.py", it helps to develop
   Localizer based products that become monolingual when Localizer
   is not installed (instead of becoming broken). It provides dummy
   versions for some of the features of Localizer, not all.
